# d3-ethnicity-graph
A d3 bar graph of race/ethnicity by neighborhood in Philadelphia

## Set up
1. Download or fork this repo
2. For this baby project, I'm using [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to run it locally
   * Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
   * Install http-server globally so it can be run though the command line: `npm install http-server -g`
   * Navigate to the root of your project and run `http-server`
   * Now you should be able to access your files in a web browser at `localhost:8080`
3. Have fun with :sparkles: d3 :sparkles:
